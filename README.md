# programation
programation stands for "**Progra**mmatic Ani**mation**", basically drawing
with a computer, but that sounded fancier. After watching videos from
[https://www.3blue1brown.com/](3blue1brown) I was inspired to make my own
animation toolkit, based on [https://github.com/3b1b/manim](his). My goal is to
create this completely on my own, though I've taken a few things from his
project (cited in source).
