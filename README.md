# programation
programation stands for "**Progra**mmatic Ani**mation**", basically drawing
with a computer, but that sounded fancier. After watching videos from
[3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) I was inspired to make my own
animation toolkit, based on [his](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). My goal is to
create this completely on my own, though I've taken a few things from his
project (cited in source).
